# 4523M-assignment
This is an end-of-module assignment for the 22/23 year ITP4523M module (Internet & Multimedia Applications Development). Due to quitting of my partner, I only did the purchase manager part of the project.
1.	Objectives
In this project, students are asked to:
build a web application which provides different functions for Purchase Manager and Supplier.
apply software development skills to develop a website which is user-friendly, interactive, robust and easy to maintain.
apply the knowledge that you learned in this module to solve the tasks. (i.e. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL commands and Python)

2.	A simplified procedure to show how the web application will be used
There are two user roles for the management System:
a.	A Purchase Manager can make the orders and retrieve the Order records.
b.	A Supplier can manage its own items.
